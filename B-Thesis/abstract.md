# Abstract

As software development projects grow in complexity, efficient methods for managing codebases become increasingly necessary. This thesis introduces the Entity Inspector (EI) extension for Visual Studio Code (VSCode), designed to assist developers in effectively managing their codebases. The EI extension provides a centralized overview of all entities within the codebase, facilitating easy navigation and faster information retrieval. It also offers automated entity generation and hints for existing entities, enabling code reuse and minimizing duplication of work.

The Connected VSCode extension enhances developers' workflow by providing assistance in writing annotations, offering both static and dynamic suggestions powered by the Expert Intelligence (EI) model. Moreover, the extension enables seamless integration through the import and export of entities from external projects or schemes.

Furthermore, the Entity Inspector extension promotes code organization by providing a consolidated view of entity information, enhancing understanding of their purpose and functionality. This promotes maintainable code and facilitates improved collaboration among team members.

In conclusion, the Entity Inspector extension for VSCode empowers developers with efficient object management, enhanced collaboration, and improved code quality. Future enhancements and extensions can leverage the annotation-based linking capabilities, further advancing efficient and interconnected software development.
