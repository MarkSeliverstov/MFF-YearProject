# Introduction

Software development projects are becoming increasingly complex, requiring efficient methods for managing and organizing the code base. As the size and complexity of code bases grow, developers face challenges in navigating through the code, understanding its structure, and maintaining its quality.These issues can hinder productivity, collaboration, and code reuse, ultimately impacting the overall efficiency of software development processes.

To solve these problems, this thesis introduces the Entity Inspector (EI) extension for Visual Studio Code (VSCode). The Entity Inspector extension aims to provide developers with a comprehensive tool for managing and inspecting workflow, offering a centralized view of entities and facilitating efficient code exploration.

The primary objective of the Entity Inspector extension is to enhance code base management by providing developers with an overview of all entities within their projects. This includes classes, functions, variables, and other components that make up the code base. The extension allows developers to quickly navigate through the code base, understand its structure and find specific objects. Now developers don't need to keep track of hundreds of objects, the extension will do it instead of them. 

The extension also includes visualization capabilities to represent the code base structure, making it easier to grasp the overall organization and dependencies between entities.

Furthermore, the Entity Inspector extension promotes code reuse and collaboration by facilitating the identification and management of existing entities. Developers can leverage the extension to automatically generate entities when needed or receive hints about relevant existing entities. This promotes code consistency, reduces duplication, and enhances collaboration among team members.

Overall, the Entity Inspector extension for VSCode aims to improve code base management, navigation, and collaboration in software development projects. By providing developers with a powerful tool for code exploration and organization, the extension aims to enhance productivity, code quality, and collaboration within development teams. The subsequent sections of this thesis will delve into the methodology, implementation, evaluation, and potential future enhancements of the Entity Inspector extension, providing a comprehensive understanding of its capabilities and impact on software development practices.
